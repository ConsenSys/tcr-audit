Throughout the contract system, calls are made to the token contract followed by state changes in the contracts themselves. Token contracts can perform reentrancy attacks to take advantage of this.

**Recommendation**

Move token contract calls after all state changes in each function. Alternatively, document that TCRs must use trusted token contracts that cannot call other contracts.
