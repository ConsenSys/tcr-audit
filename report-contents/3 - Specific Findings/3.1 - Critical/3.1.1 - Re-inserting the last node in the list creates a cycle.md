The changes in [`52d97ca2`](https://github.com/skmgoldin/sol-dll/commit/52d97ca2d43fe3d7125f1db241a0a5f9911452fd) address most of the inconsistent list states from re-inserting an existing node, but one remains: if the last node is reinserted with itself as the previous node, the node sets its next and previous pointers to itself, and the actual previous item in the list isn't updated to point to the right place.

```

Remove the current item from the list as early as possible in the function, right after the null node check. Since `_prev` will no longer be in the list, the `contains()` check will fail and the cycle won't be created. Make it harder to exploit lists that somehow get into a broken state by checking the invariants for `_next`, even though we expect them to always be consistent with the checks for `_prev`. Add a README that describes `DLL` as a list of unique elements.
