`now + get("pApplyStageLen")` and `now + get("pApplyStageLen") + get("pCommitStageLen") + get("pRevealStageLen") + PROCESSBY` can overflow.

**Recommendation**

Use [SafeMath](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol) for arithmetic, and assert that these calculations succeed in `processProposal` so proposals can't get the contract in a state where the arithmetic for new proposals will revert every transaction.
