`voteTokenBalance[msg.sender] - getLockedTokens(msg.sender)` can underflow. This shouldn't underflow under normal circumstances, but detecting the underflow makes it harder to exploit abnormal circumstances.

**Recommendation**

Use [SafeMath](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol) for arithmetic.
