`listingHash.applicationExpiry = block.timestamp + parameterizer.get("applyStageLen")` can overflow.

**Recommendation**

Use [SafeMath](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol) for arithmetic. If the token holders set `applyStageLen` too high, all new applications will revert until they pass a proposal to change the setting.
