PLCRVoting determines the winner with `(100 * poll.votesFor) > (poll.voteQuorum * (poll.votesFor + poll.votesAgainst))`. As a result, polls resolve as failing when they expire with no votes. This is probably the right behavior, but it's surprising.

The existing comments about this behavior are inconsistent.

Parameterizer.sol: `// Edge case, nobody voted, give all tokens to the winner.`

Registry.sol: `// Edge case, nobody voted, give all tokens to the challenger.`

**Recommendation**

Near the calls to `voting.isPassed`, document that either the challenge didn't get enough votes, or nobody voted at all.
