If `pMinDeposit` is changed after a proposal has been created, tokens will not be distributed properly.

If `pMinDeposit` is increased, `challenge.stake` and `challenge.rewardPool` will be based on a larger value than what the proposer deposited. Winning challengers will attempt to withdraw `(2 * challenges[_challengeID].stake) - challenges[_challengeID].rewardPool`, which will fail if the deposit has been increased enough to make the reward pool larger than the proposer's deposit. Even when it succeeds, the reward pool will be larger than the balance that remains the contract, so some voters won't get rewarded.

If `pMinDeposit` is decreased, `challenge.stake` and `challenge.rewardPool` will be based on a smaller value than what the proposer deposited. The winner will withdraw `(2 * challenges[_challengeID].stake) - challenges[_challengeID].rewardPool`, which will leave some tokens allocated neither to the winner nor the winning voters. The tokens will remain stuck in the contract.

**Recommendation**

In `challengeReparameterization`, don't reference `pMinDeposit`. Reference `proposal.deposit` so challenges are always consistent with their proposals.
