`pollExists` doesn't check if a poll exists. It attempts to check if a poll's stage times are reasonable, but misses polls that allow users to commit to a vote later than they can reveal their vote, which would lock their tokens permanently.

**Recommendation**

In `startPoll`, require reasonable stage times. Both must be greater than `block.timestamp`, and `commitEndDate` must be less than `revealEndDate`. Remove sanity checks from `pollExists` and just require that `_pollID <= pollNonce` so users can't vote on polls that haven't been started yet.
