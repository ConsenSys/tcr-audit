`100 - get("pDispensationPct")` can underflow, which would allow tokens to be drained from the contract.

**Recommendation**

Use [SafeMath](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol) for arithmetic, and assert that these calculations succeed in processProposal so proposals can't get the contract in a state where the arithmetic for new challenges will revert every transaction.
