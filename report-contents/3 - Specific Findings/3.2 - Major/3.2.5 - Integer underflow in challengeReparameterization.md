`100 - get("pDispensationPct")` can underflow, which would allow tokens to be drained from the contract.

**Recommendation**

Use SafeMath for arithmetic, and assert that these calculations succeed in processProposal so proposals can't get the contract in a state where the arithmetic for new challenges will revert every transaction.
