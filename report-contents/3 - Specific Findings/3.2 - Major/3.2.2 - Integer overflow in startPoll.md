`commitEndDate: block.timestamp + _commitDuration` and `revealEndDate: block.timestamp + _commitDuration + _revealDuration` can overflow. This can result in polls that will accept votes, but never unlock tokens in the current code.

**Recommendation**

Use [SafeMath](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol) for arithmetic.
